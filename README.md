# similarity
trying out different algos for similarity score between two texts

1. **BERT-Based Models:** BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and its variants (e.g., RoBERTa, ALBERT) are powerful for capturing contextual information and semantic similarity.

2. **Siamese Networks:** Siamese networks are designed specifically for similarity tasks and can be used to assess similarity between pairs of student and ideal answers.

3. **Sentence Transformers:** Models like Sentence-BERT focus on sentence-level semantics and can be used to calculate similarity between student and ideal answers.

4. **Word Embeddings with Context:** Word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText can capture word semantics within the context of a sentence, which can be useful for assessing similarity.

5. **Universal Sentence Encoder:** Google's Universal Sentence Encoder encodes sentences into fixed-length vectors, capturing semantic meaning and enabling similarity calculations.

6. **BERT-as-a-Service:** Some services and libraries offer BERT embeddings as a service, simplifying the process of encoding text and calculating similarity scores.
